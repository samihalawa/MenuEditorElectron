# MelindaAI WYSIWYG Quick Editor

## Introduction

MelindaAI Editor is an Electron-based text and code editor developed specifically for macOS. It is engineered to cater to a wide spectrum of users, from individuals seeking a quick note-taking solution accessible via the macOS menu bar to developers in need of a robust environment for editing and live previewing code. The project integrates dual editor functionalities, offering both Quill and CKEditor to provide flexibility and adaptability in content creation and management.


## Core Features

- **Dual Editor Integration**: Incorporates Quill and CKEditor, allowing users to select their preferred editing interface. This feature aims to cater to diverse user preferences, offering a rich text editor for general note-taking and a more structured editor for specific formatting needs.
  
- **Menu Bar Quick Access**: Designed for efficiency, the menu bar feature provides immediate access to a simplified editor. This is particularly useful for rapid note-taking or code snippet creation without the need to switch contexts or open the main application window.

- **Persistent Content State**: Utilizes local storage to automatically save the user's session, ensuring that all work is preserved and readily available upon application restart. This feature addresses the critical need for data persistence and loss prevention.

- **Editor Switching Mechanism**: A built-in functionality that allows users to seamlessly switch between Quill and CKEditor within the application, facilitating a versatile editing experience tailored to the task at hand.

- **Developer-friendly Code Mode**: Offers a specialized mode for directly editing and previewing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, catering to developers who require an integrated environment for web development.

- **File Management Capabilities**: Supports opening, editing, and saving files directly within the app. This fundamental feature streamlines the workflow by eliminating the need for external text editing applications.

## Proposed Features and Enhancements

1. **Cloud Synchronization**: Integrate with cloud storage solutions (e.g., Dropbox API, Google Drive API) to enable cross-device synchronization of notes and code snippets.
   
2. **Syntax Highlighting Expansion**: Utilize libraries such as Prism (https://prismjs.com/) to enhance support for a broader range of programming languages, improving the app's utility for developers.

3. **Extensible Plugin Architecture**: Design a plugin system allowing users and developers to extend the editor with custom functionalities, similar to the approach taken by Atom (https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-writing-packages).

4. **Markdown Editing and Previewing**: Integrate a markdown editor and previewer, leveraging libraries like Marked (https://github.com/markedjs/marked) to cater to writers and developers who use markdown for documentation and note-taking.

5. **Collaborative Editing Feature**: Incorporate real-time collaborative editing using technologies such as Yjs (https://github.com/yjs/yjs) to enable multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously.

6. **Dark Mode Support**: Implement a dark mode theme for the application, considering user preferences for reduced eye strain and improved focus, particularly in low-light environments.

7. **Customizable UI Themes**: Allow users to customize the application's appearance by selecting or creating themes, enhancing personalization and user experience.

8. **Advanced File Management**: Introduce features for better file organization, such as folders, tags, and search functionality, using Node.js file system module (fs) for backend operations.

9. **Speech-to-Text Input**: Integrate speech recognition for note-taking and coding, potentially utilizing the Web Speech API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for a hands-free user experience.

10. **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure the application is accessible, following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), to accommodate users with disabilities.
